Contact: tristan.marsell@t-online.de

Current Version: 11.0
Codename: Auralia

INTRODUCTION
-------------
PDesireAudio is a kernel driver by Tristan Marsell and Team DevElite, based on WCD drivers by Qualcomm.
Two modes are included:

	PDesireAudio Ultra High Quality Mode:
	Forked from the WCD9xxx Ultra High Quality Mode but more advanced
	Main Features:
		-disable every possible CSLH stream to save more power
		-enable CLSAB streams to minimize distortion on high and low frequencies 
		-disable all compander streams (COMP0, COMP1, etc.) to reduce distortion
		-disable all decimator streams (DEC0, DEC1, etc.) to disable cut-offs on audio
		-Microphone dynamic High Pass Filter bypass
		-little bit power saving due less streams
		-Set default amperages higher on SPKDRV 
		-Dynamic to improve power usage
		-API Block/Static mode included
		-Compander deadwriting now available
		-Buffer Increase for LPA

	Fixed:
	-Format set to right position and declaration (CAF, I don't know what you have done, but that is not good)
		
		

ACCESSIBILITY & API
--------------------
PDesireAudio Mode is on by default, to change that
change the value on /sys/modules/snd_soc_wcd9330/PDesireAudio to 0
in your sysfs

If you want to implement the switch in a code for kernel:

Header file needs to be imported:
#include <sound/pdesireaudio/api.h>

API DESCRIPTION:

	pdesireaudio_is_enabled()
	returns 1 if it is enabled and 0 if it is not

	enable_pdesireaudio()
	Enable PDesireAudio and re-init PDesireAudio
	
	disable_pdesireaudio()
	Disable PDesireAudio and re-init PDesireAudio
	
	reinit_pdesireaudio()
	Re-init PDesireAudio
	
	static_mode_pdesireaudio(true/false);
	Set PDesireAudio so static mode or to dynamic mode
	
	The Static mode allows user to make changes without influence from other modules 
	and libs which control PDesireAudio
	With False you enable Dynamic mode and with true you enable Static mode
	
	
You can implement it anywhere and via calling the methods above shown control PDesireAudio
